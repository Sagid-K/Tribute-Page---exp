          <p><b>Agriculture</b> in Sudan plays a vital role in that country's economy. Agriculture and livestock raising are the primary sources of livelihood for most of the Sudanese population. It was estimated that, as of 2011, 80 percent of the labor force were employed in that sector, including 84 percent of the women and 64 percent of the men.</p>
          <p>Agriculture and livestock raising are among the main sources of livelihood in Sudan for more than 62% of the working population in the early 1990s. Sudan is considered one of the three largest countries on the African continent in terms of area and one of the most important countries in the world in which water and arable agricultural land are available with approximately one third of its total area of 1,886,068 square kilometers (728,215 square miles), making it a confirmed global “food basket”. .</p>
